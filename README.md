# Configuration Files

This repository hosts my configuration files for command line
programs that I use frequently including zsh, vim and tmux. I 
use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) for managing these
so, to get started:

```
$ git clone --recursive-submodules https://code.nfsmith.ca/nsmith/dotfiles ~/.dofiles
$ sudo dnf install -y rcm 	# Or equivalent
$ rcup
```

Now, restart your shell and you're ready to rumble.
